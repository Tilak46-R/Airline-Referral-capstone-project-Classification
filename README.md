Overview
This project focuses on predicting airline passenger referral behavior based on a dataset containing passenger reviews and various travel-related factors. The primary aim is to help airlines gain insights into passenger preferences and sentiments to improve their services and boost customer loyalty.

Project Files
Airline_referal.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
data_airline_reviews.xlsx: The dataset file in Excel format, which includes the data required for analysis.
Data Preprocessing and Analysis
The Jupyter notebook, Airline_referal.ipynb, details the data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Data preprocessing involves handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features. EDA explores relationships between features and the target variable.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step for creating meaningful input features for machine learning models. The Airline_referal.ipynb notebook contains Python scripts related to feature engineering techniques applied to the dataset.

Model Building
We have experimented with various machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
These models were fine-tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. The details can be found in the Airline_referal.ipynb notebook.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated model performance using essential metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are documented in the Airline_referal.ipynb notebook.
