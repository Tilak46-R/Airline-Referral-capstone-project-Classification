# Airline-Referral-capstone-project-Classification


Airline plays an important role in connecting people all across the world from one part to another.

Hence it is important to have data related to airline and how well the airlines can improve through passengers review and feedback .

This data was collected during spring 2019 and it uses classification algorithm because we are classifying recommendations as either "yes or no" in this project.

This is an individual project and the inspiration came from AlmaBetter .

Future collaborations are welcomed ..
